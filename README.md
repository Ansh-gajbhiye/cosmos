# ðŸŒŒ COSMOS

**A 3D Space-Themed Interactive Web Experience**

---

##  Overview

**COSMOS** is a space-themed 3D web project that allows users to explore and interact with a virtual solar system. The goal is to create an immersive and educational experience using modern web technologies that bring planets and cosmic elements to life.

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Next.js** â€“ Framework for building performant and scalable React applications.
* **TypeScript** â€“ Adds type safety and better developer experience.
* **Three.js** â€“ JavaScript 3D library to render planets, space, and interactions in real time.
* **React Three Fiber** (optional but recommended) â€“ React renderer for Three.js to simplify integration.

---

##  Features (Planned)

* Realistic 3D models of planets with rotation and orbit animations
* Interactive planetary system (click/tap on planets for information)
* Smooth camera transitions and zoom controls
* Responsive layout and device support
* Educational tooltips or modal windows with planet facts

---

##  Inspiration

The idea behind COSMOS is to blend art, science, and technology into a visually appealing interface that makes learning about space fun. Inspired by other 3D experiences and the desire to build something both beautiful and informative.
